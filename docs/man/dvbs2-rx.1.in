.SH NAME
dvbs2-rx \- A DVB-S2 receiver application based on the GNU Radio framework.
.SH DESCRIPTION
dvbs2-rx is an open-source DVB-S2 software-defined receiver application based on
the gr-dvbs2rx GNU Radio out-of-tree module. It provides a wide range of
customizable DVB-S2 parameters, such as the MODCOD, frame size, physical layer
pilots, roll-off factor, and much more. The application takes a baseband DVB-S2
modulated IQ streqm on its input and ouputs the decoded MPEG Transport Stream.
.SH OPTIONS
See dvbs2-rx \-\-help for the full list of command-line options.
.PP
The main options are the ones determining the primary DVB-S2 reception
parameters. More specifically, the sample rate (option --samp-rate), the symbol
rate (--sym-rate), the center frequency (--freq), the MODCOD (--modcod), the
frame size (--frame-size), the roll-off factor (--rolloff), and the Gold code
(--gold-code). Also, when the presence or absence of physical layer pilots is
known a priori, it is recommended to specify it using the --pilots option.
.PP
Other than reception parameters, it is essential to determine the input and
output interfaces. By default, the dvbs2-rx application expects the incoming
baseband IQ stream on its stdin (option --source=fd) with IQ samples represented
as interleaved 32-bit floating-point numbers for I and Q, respectively. However,
it also supports other IQ formats and sources. It can read the IQ stream
directly from a file (--source=file) or interface directly to an SDR device. For
the latter, it supports both RTL-SDRs and USRPs using options --source=rtl and
--source=usrp, respectively, with a number of device-specific options for them.
.PP
For monitoring, dvbs2-rx provides three options. First, it features an optional
GUI (option --gui), which can be used for for runtime control and monitoring.
Secondly, it can optionally launch a server for on-demand probing of receiver
metrics over HTTP (option --mon-server). Third, it can be configured to
periodically print receiver metrics to the console (option --log-stats).
