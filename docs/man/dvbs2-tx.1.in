.SH NAME
dvbs2-tx \- A DVB-S2 transmitter application based on the GNU Radio framework.
.SH DESCRIPTION
dvbs2-tx is an open-source DVB-S2 transmitter application based on the GNU Radio
Digital TV (DTV) in-tree module and the gr-dvbs2rx out-of-tree module. It
provides a wide range of customizable DVB-S2 parameters, such as the MODCOD,
frame size, physical layer pilots, roll-off factor, and much more. The
application takes an MPEG Transport Stream on its input and ouputs the baseband
modulated IQ stream to either the stdout, a file, or directly to a USRP. It also
provides a GUI for runtime control and monitoring.
